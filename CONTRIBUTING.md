## ü™≤ Reporting Bugs
This section guides you through submitting a bug report for this repository. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports. Before creating bug reports, please perform a cursory search to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has and the issue is still open, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one. Note: If you find a Closed issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as GitHub issues. After you've determined which repository your bug is related to, create an issue on that repository and provide the following information by filling in the template.

Explain the problem and include additional details to help a developer reproduce the problem:
*	Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the problem.
*	Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem in as many details as possible. Along with it, provide the details regarding the name and version of OS, Python version, configuration of the environment, if used any.
*	Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/paste able snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use Markdown code blocks.
*	Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
*	Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.
*	If the problem is related to performance or memory, include details of the errors encountered with your report.
*	Can you reliably reproduce the issue? If not, provide details about how often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens.

### Before Submitting A Bug Report

Please check existing bug reports instead of opening a new one. There is a possibility that there are fixes already posted for bugs. If not, you are welcome to submit a bug report and we will look into it as soon as possible.

## üìù Suggesting Enhancements and New features

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for this project:

### How Do I Submit A (Good) Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as GitHub issues. Create an issue on that repository with an enhancement or feature tag and provide the following information:
*	Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the suggestion.
*	Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement in as many details as possible.
*	Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps. Include copy/paste able snippets which you use in those examples, as Markdown code blocks.
*	Describe the current behavior and explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.
*   Documentation is an integral part of our repository. Submit updates and improvements to documentations.
*   Share with us any new exciting feature you might have in mind.

## üôá Pull Requests
1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
2. Update the [README.md](https://github.com/NCSU-Group7-SE2021/slash/blob/main/README.md) with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the [README.md](https://github.com/NCSU-Group7-SE2021/slash/blob/main/README.md) to the new version that this Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is SemVer.
4. After submitting your PR, the first thing you would want to do will be a self review. Barring special circumstances, maintainers will not review PRs until all checks pass (Travis, AppVeyor, etc).
5. One or more maintainers will use GitHub's review feature to review your PR.
6. If the maintainer asks for any changes, edit your changes, push, and ask for another review. Additional tags (such as needs-tests) will be added depending on the review.
7. If the maintainer decides to pass on your PR, they will thank you for the contribution and explain why they won't be accepting the changes. That's ok! We still really appreciate you taking the time to do it, and we don't take that lightly.
8. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.

## üëí Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages
*	Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
*	Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
*	Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
*	Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
*	When only changing documentation, include [ci skip] in the commit title

### Git Branching Naming Convention
Not using appropriate naming conventions leads to confusion and complicates the code maintenance team. We can‚Äôt ignore Git best practices in branching naming conventions.

- Main (main) is the default branch available in the Git repository. It should be stable all the time and won‚Äôt allow any direct check-in. You can only merge it after code review. All team members are responsible for keeping the master stable and up-to-date.

- <b>Make sure the new branch you create follows proper naming conventions.</b>
```<author>-<date in (DD-MMMM) format>-<short-feature-description>```
<br> E.g., rahil-6-sept-test-badge
E.g., moksh-7-sept-web-scraping

This method allows for easy tracking of different developers‚Äô work and progress with additional systems.
